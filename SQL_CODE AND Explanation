T
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT country ORDER BY country SEPARATOR ';') AS countries
    FROM
    diary;

GROUP_CONCAT() concatenates distinct values from the country column into a single string.
SEPARATOR ';' specifies that semicolons (;) should be used as separators between concatenated values.

Output: For instance, if the distinct country names are 'Australia', 'Austria', 'France', 'Ireland', 'Japan', the output will be a single row containing the concatenated string 'Australia;Austria;France;Ireland;Japan'.

Use cases:  to concat (with separators) 

Note: GROUP_CONCAT while working Vertically (entries in a column, a1+a2+a3+.... ) and CONCAT while working horizontally (a1+b1+c1+...). 

Q22:  Example of GROUP_CONCAT() and CONCAT()

SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(

        ORDER BY player_number
        SEPARATOR '; '
    ) AS players
